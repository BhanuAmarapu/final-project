## 🔍 Duplicate Detection Feature

### How It Works

When you upload a file, the system performs intelligent duplicate detection:

1. **Hash Computation**: File hash (SHA-256) is computed immediately
2. **Exact Match Check**: System searches for identical files with the same hash
3. **Content Similarity Analysis**: TF-IDF algorithm analyzes file content to detect near-duplicates (60%+ match)
4. **Metadata Analysis**: ML model analyzes file size, name, and frequency
5. **Visual Alerts**: Color-coded alerts show match type with similarity percentages

### Match Types

#### 🔴 Identical Files (Exact Match)
- **Detection**: Files with identical hash (100% match)
- **Visual**: Red alert with "Identical File Found!" message
- **Display**: Table showing existing files with "EXACT MATCH" badges
- **Storage Info**: Shows S3 bucket location or local storage path
- **Action**: Choose "Store Anyway" (creates reference) or "Don't Store" (cancel)

#### ⚠️ Similar Files (Metadata Match)
- **Detection**: Files with similar name/size but different content
- **Visual**: Orange alert with "Potential Duplicate Detected"
- **Display**: Table showing similar files for comparison
- **Storage Info**: Shows where each similar file is stored
- **Action**: Review and decide whether to proceed with upload

#### 📊 Content Similarity Detection (TF-IDF)
- **Detection**: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to detect near-duplicate files with 60%+ content similarity
- **Algorithm**: Computes cosine similarity between document vectors
- **Supported Files**: 
  - Text files: `.txt`, `.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.sql`
  - Image files: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif` (Uses GPT-4 Vision to extract text and visual context)
  - PDF files: Extracts text using PyPDF2
- **Visual**: Yellow alert with "Near-Duplicate Files Found" and similarity percentage
- **Display**: Table showing similar files with exact similarity scores (e.g., "85.3% Similar")
- **Features**:
  - Works even when files have different names or sizes
  - Detects renamed files, slightly modified versions, or paraphrased content
  - Shows download button for existing similar files
  - Displays top 5 most similar files
- **Action**: Choose "Store Anyway" or "Don't Store" after reviewing similar files

### User Workflow Example

```
1. User uploads "report.pdf" (5MB)
2. System detects identical file already exists in S3
3. Red alert appears with:
   - File details (name, size, hash)
   - Existing file location: "☁️ S3 Bucket: s3://my-bucket/abc123_report.pdf"
   - Download button to access existing file
4. User chooses:
   - "Store Anyway" → Creates ownership reference (saves storage)
   - "Don't Store" → Cancels upload
```

### Benefits

- **Storage Savings**: Avoid uploading duplicate files to S3
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize cloud storage costs
- **Quick Access**: Download existing files instead of re-uploading
- **Transparency**: See exactly where files are stored (S3 or local)

## 🛡️ AI Content Moderation

### Overview

The system includes real-time AI content moderation that automatically scans uploaded files for inappropriate content **before** storage. Using TF-IDF machine learning algorithm, it intelligently detects and rejects:

- **EXPLICIT** content (adult, sexual, pornographic material)
- **PROFANITY** (curse words, vulgar language)
- **VIOLENCE** (violent content, weapons, hate speech)

### How It Works

1. **Upload Initiated**: User selects file to upload
2. **Pre-Storage Scan**: File is analyzed using TF-IDF algorithm
3. **Similarity Analysis**: Content is compared against known bad content patterns
4. **Decision**: 
   - If similarity ≥ 35% → ❌ **REJECTED** (file deleted, user notified, admin alerted)
   - If similarity < 35% → ✅ **ALLOWED** (continues to deduplication)

### TF-IDF Algorithm

The moderation system uses **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** for intelligent content analysis:

```
Training Data → TF-IDF Vectorization → Cosine Similarity → Rejection Decision
```

**Benefits over keyword matching**:
- ✅ Context-aware analysis
- ✅ Fewer false positives
- ✅ Confidence scoring
- ✅ Auto-categorization

### Supported File Types

**Text Files** (Full Content Analysis):
- `.txt`, `.md`, `.log`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`
- `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.html`, `.css`, `.sql`
- `.pdf` (text extraction via PyPDF2)

**Image Files** (Multimodal Analysis):
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`
- Analyzes image content using **GPT-4 Vision** for strict safety moderation and **DINOv2** for deep semantic image matching and deduplication.

### What Happens on Rejection

1. 🚫 **Upload Rejected**: User sees "Your upload has been rejected due to violation of content policies."
2. 📝 **Logged**: Rejection securely saved to `moderation_logs` table with details and User Identity (Name and Email).
3. 🚨 **Admin Alert**: Automatic alert created in `suspicious_activities` table with the user's details.
4. 🗑️ **File Deleted**: Temp file immediately removed from server (no prohibited content is ever stored).
5. 📊 **Trackable**: Admins can review all rejections at `/admin/moderation`.

### Admin Moderation Panel

Admins can access `/admin/moderation` to:
- View all rejected uploads
- Securely track User Identity (Username and Email) linked to policy violations
- See specific violation types and flagged keywords
- Filter by reviewed/unreviewed status
- Add reviewer notes
- Track moderation statistics

### Configuration

Adjust moderation threshold in `content_moderator.py`:
```python
moderator = ContentModerator(threshold=0.35)  # 35% similarity
```

**Threshold Recommendations**:
- `0.30` (30%) - Strict mode
- `0.35` (35%) - **Default** (balanced)
- `0.40` (40%) - Lenient mode

## 🎙️ Audio & Video Processing Pipelines (AWS S3 Optimized)

The system features advanced pipelines for secure, optimized storage of audio and video files directly integrated with **AWS S3**.

### 1. Asynchronous Audio Deduplication & Polling
- **Immediate Cloud Sync**: When an audio file is uploaded, the background thread performs S3 uploading **first** as its primary action. This ensures the file is backed up to S3 within seconds.
- **Non-Blocking AJAX Polling**: To prevent HTTP request timeouts during long audio file evaluations, the server immediately returns a success status with a process ID. The frontend dynamically polls `/audio/status/<id>` every 2 seconds via AJAX.
- **CPU Performance Tuning**:
  - **Thread Optimization**: Limits PyTorch CPU threading (`torch.set_num_threads(4)`) to eliminate core scheduling contention overhead.
  - **Pipeline Batching**: Whisper segment chunking is batched (`batch_size=8`) to transcribing chunks concurrently.
  - **Lighter Vector Models**: Generates embeddings using the fast and lightweight Sentence-BERT model `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`.
- **Similarity Confirmation Modal**: If similarity matching $\ge 60\%$, polling stops, the loader is cleared, and an interactive Bootstrap modal popup appears containing matching metadata (original filename, similarity score, and transcript snippet). The user selects:
  - **Store anyway**: Keeps the file in S3 and completes database records.
  - **Cancel upload**: Purges S3 storage object and database rows.

### 2. Dedicated Video Pipeline
- **Bypassed AI Pipeline**: Video files (e.g. `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.webm`) bypass Whisper transcription and Sentence-BERT embedding, and upload directly to AWS S3.
- **Dedicated Videos Section**: Registered video uploads are displayed on a dedicated **Videos** tab on the main dashboard.
- **Inline Streaming**: Both audio and video tabs support the **Open** action, which streams decrypted/raw media files inline using headers like `Content-Disposition: inline` so they play directly in your web browser.

### 3. Automated S3 Object Purges on Deletion
- All delete actions on the portal (Standard Files, Audios, and Videos) are mapped directly to AWS S3. Whenever a record is deleted from the dashboard portal, the corresponding AWS S3 object key is automatically deleted from your S3 bucket.

### Setup and Configuration
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set configuration values in your `.env` file (e.g. `USE_S3=True` and S3 credentials).
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Note

This project implements AES-256 convergent encryption. All uploaded standard files are encrypted locally before syncing to AWS S3. Secret keys, database credentials, and AWS tokens are securely managed via `.env` configuration. Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is randomized in production environments.
